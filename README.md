# 📘 DSA – Data Structures & Algorithms  

This repository contains **handwritten-style DSA notes, definitions, and Java codes** written by **Bablu Kumar**.  
Every topic is organized with a unique ID (`DSA-001`, `DSA-002`, etc.) to keep sync between notebook and code files.

## 🚀 How to Use  

1. Go to `Notes/` folder for **theory & handwritten-style notes**.  
2. Check `Codes/` folder for **Java implementations**.  
3. Each file is mapped by a **unique ID** (e.g., `DSA-003-Arrays.java`).
