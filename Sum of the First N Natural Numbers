### **What is it?**

To calculate the total of all numbers from 1 to N (like 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + N)

---

### ✅ **Logic:**

We can use:

1. **Formula Method:**
    
    `sum = n * (n + 1) / 2` → Fastest
    
2. **Loop Method (for/while loop):**
    
    Add numbers one by one from 1 to N.

### 🧮 **Formula Code:**

```java
int n = 10;
int sum = n * (n + 1) / 2;
System.out.println("Sum is: " + sum);
```

🧠 *Best when only the sum is needed — no steps required.*

---

### 🔁 **Using Loop (for loop):**

```java
int n = 10;
int sum = 0;

for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    sum = sum + i;
}
System.out.println("Sum is: " + sum);
```

🧠 *Useful when learning how loops work.*

---

### 🧠 One Line Logic:

Use `n*(n+1)/2` for speed,

Use loop for step-by-step logic.
