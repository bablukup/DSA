### What is Scope?

> Scope refers to the region in code where a variable is accessible.
> 
> 
> In Java, every variable exists only within a specific block — that’s its scope.
> 

---

### 🔹 What is Method Scope?

> A variable declared inside a method is called a local variable.
> 
> 
> It can only be accessed **within that method**.
> 

📌 When the method is called → variable is created

📌 When the method ends → variable is destroyed

### 🧪 Java Code Example:

```java

public class Main {

    static void greet() {
        String name = "Bablu";
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name); // ✅ Valid here
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        greet();
        // System.out.println(name); ❌ Error: 'name' not accessible here
    }
}
```

🔍 `name` is declared **inside `greet()`** — so it's only valid there.

### 📓 Notebook Summary:

```java

📌 Method Scope:
→ Variable declared inside a method
→ Also known as: Local Variable

✅ Accessible only within that method
❌ Not visible outside the method

🔁 Created when method runs
🗑️ Destroyed when method ends

🛠️ Helps isolate logic & save memory

```

### 🔍 Interview Tip:

> Method scope avoids naming conflicts and improves memory efficiency.
> 

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Method Scope | Variable inside a method |
| Local Variable | Another name for method-scoped variable |
| Lifetime | During method execution only |

---

### 🧠 Real-Life Analogy:

> A local variable is like a pen inside a drawer.
> 
> 
> You can only use it **while the drawer is open** 🖊️🔓
