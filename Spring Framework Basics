2. Spring Framework Basics (IoC Container) 🌱
🧠 Logic:The Spring Framework is the most popular Java Enterprise framework, providing a comprehensive programming and configuration model for building modern, robust, and scalable applications.Core Component: The IoC Container (Inversion of Control Container, often called the Spring Container) is the heart of the framework. It is responsible for:Creating objects (known as Beans).Configuring those objects (setting properties).Wiring them together (performing Dependency Injection).Managing their entire lifecycle.You define the beans and their dependencies, and the Spring Container handles the rest using annotations (like @Component, @Autowired) or XML configuration.📌 Example (Spring Bean):Java// Annotation marking the class as a component managed by Spring
@Component
public class DatabaseService {
    // ...
}

// Spring Container creates an instance of DatabaseService 
// and makes it available for injection elsewhere.
