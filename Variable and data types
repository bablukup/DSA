### **How Java Code Runs (For Concept Only – Not Core DSA)**

---

### 🧠 What Happens?

> Java source code is compiled into bytecode using javac,
> 
> 
> and then executed by the **JVM** (Java Virtual Machine).
>

### 🔁 **Flow:**

```java
Main.java
   ⬇ (compiled by javac)
Main.class (Bytecode)
   ⬇ (runs inside JVM)
Machine Code → Output

```

---

### 🧩 **Keywords:**

- **javac**: Java compiler (creates `.class` file)
- **Bytecode**: Platform-independent code
- **JVM**: Runs bytecode on any OS
- **Machine Code**: Final code executed by system

---

### 💡 **1-Line Summary:**

> Java → Bytecode → JVM → Output

> 
> (*Write once, run anywhere*)

### 🧠 What is JVM?

> JVM = Java Virtual Machine
> 
> 
> Runs bytecode (.class) on any OS
> 
> It provides platform independence.
> 

### 🧠 What is Bytecode?

> Bytecode = compiled Java code
> 
> 
> Generated by `javac`, executed by JVM
> 
> Platform-independent format
