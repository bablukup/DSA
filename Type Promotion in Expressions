### 🧠 Rule:

```java
byte → short → int → long → float → double

```

---

### 📌 Example 1:

```java
byte a = 10;
byte b = 20;
int result = a + b; // a and b promoted to int
```

---

### 📌 Example 2:

```java
int x = 5;
float y = 6.5f;
float result = x + y; // x promoted to float
```

---

### 💡 Logic in 1 Line:

> Java promotes smaller data types to match the biggest one in the expression.
