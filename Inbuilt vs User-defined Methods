### 1-Line Logic:

- **Inbuilt Methods** → Already provided by Java
- **User-defined Methods** → We create ourselves to reuse logic

---

### 🔍 Difference Table:

| 🔹 Feature | 🏗 Inbuilt Method | 🛠 User-defined Method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 📌 Defined By | Java / Library | Programmer (You) |
| 🧱 Example | `Math.sqrt()`, `System.out.println()` | `add()`, `multiply()`, `isPrime()` |
| ⚙️ Reusability | Reusable & pre-tested | Reusable if created correctly |
| 🧠 When Used | For common operations | For custom logic |
| 🔤 Syntax | Just call the method | Must define + then call |

---

### 🧪 Example Code:

**Inbuilt:**

```java
System.out.println(Math.max(10, 20));  // Output: 20
```

**User-defined:**

```java
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

### 💡 Tip to Remember:

> ✅ Use inbuilt when available
> 
> 
> 🛠 Create **user-defined** when logic is **custom or reused many times**
> 

---

### 🧠 Summary:

- **Inbuilt = ready-made tools**
- **User-defined = custom tools you build**

✅ Use both together to write clean, smart Java code.
