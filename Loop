### **What is a Loop?**

A **loop** is used to repeat a block of code multiple times until a specific condition is false.

🧠 *Use:* To avoid writing repetitive code.

---

### 💡 **Why use Loops?**

✅ Save time and effort

✅ Reduce code size

✅ Helps automate tasks like printing numbers, summing values, etc.

---

### 🔄 **3 Types of Loops in Java:**

| Loop Type | Description | Use Case Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **for loop** | Run when you know how many times | Print 1 to 100 |
| **while loop** | Run when you don't know the end time | Keep reading until "exit" |
| **do-while** | Like while, but runs **at least once** | Show menu at least once |

---

### 🔍 **One-Line Logic:**

"Use **loop** when the same logic repeats again and again."

### **1. for Loop**

📌 **Used when** the number of repetitions is known.

**Syntax:**

```java
for(initialization; condition; update) {
    // code to run
}
```

**Example:**

```java
for(int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

🧠 *Prints numbers from 1 to 5.*

---

### 🔹 **2. while Loop**

📌 **Used when** the number of repetitions is not fixed — only condition-based.

**Syntax:**

```java
while(condition) {
    // code to run
}
```

**Example:**

```java
int i = 1;
while(i <= 5) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}
```

🧠 *Also prints 1 to 5 — but condition is checked **before** loop starts.*

---

### 🔹 **3. do-while Loop**

📌 **Used when** we want the code block to run **at least once**, even if the condition is false.

**Syntax:**

```java
do {
    // code to run
} while(condition);
```

**Example:**

```java
int i = 1;
do {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
} while(i <= 5);
```

🧠 *Runs the code once, then checks the condition.*

---

### 📊 **Loop Comparison Table**

| Loop Type | Condition Checked | Runs at Least Once | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `for` | Before loop | ❌ No | Known repetitions |
| `while` | Before loop | ❌ No | Unknown repetitions |
| `do-while` | After loop | ✅ Yes | Run once, then check |

---

### 🧠 One-line logic:

**for** = fixed count,

**while** = condition-based,

**do-while** = run once, check later.
