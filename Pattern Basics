Nested Loops (Pattern Basics)
🔁 What is a Nested Loop?
A loop inside another loop.
→ Used when we need to repeat something inside a repeated process.
→ Mostly used in patterns, 2D arrays, matrices.
📌 Structure:
for (int i = 1; i <= rows; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= cols; j++) {
        // Print something
    }
    System.out.println();
}
​
👉 Outer loop → Controls number of rows
👉 Inner loop → Controls number of columns / stars / characters
🧠 Logic (in words):
Outer loop → How many lines/rows?
Inner loop → What to print in each line (stars, numbers, letters)?
🌟 Example:
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
​
for (int i = 1; i <= 4; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
        System.out.print("* ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}
​
📌 Outer loop → runs 4 times (rows)
📌 Inner loop → prints i stars in each row
🧠 Trick to Remember:
Stars increase according to the row number.
i-th row → i stars
