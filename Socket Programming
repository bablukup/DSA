2. Socket Programming (Network Communication) 🌐
🧠 Logic: Socket Programming is a way of writing programs that communicate over a network (like the internet) using Sockets. A socket is essentially one $\mathbf{endpoint}$ of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network.Java uses the $\mathbf{TCP/IP}$ model, primarily focusing on two types of sockets:ServerSocket: Used on the $\mathbf{server}$ side to wait for and accept incoming client connections.Socket: Used on the $\mathbf{client}$ side to initiate a connection, and also used by the server to handle the communication with the specific client after connection is established.Communication involves using $\mathbf{InputStreams}$ and $\mathbf{OutputStreams}$ obtained from the connected socket.📌 Example:Java// Server Side (Waiting for a client on port 6000)
ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(6000);
Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept(); // Blocks until a client connects

// Client Side (Connecting to the server at localhost:6000)
Socket socket = new Socket("localhost", 6000);
